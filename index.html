            <h1>List of Galaxies</h1>
            <p>
                The following is a list of notable galaxies. In the Local Group, there exist approximately 51 galaxies,
                while the Local Supercluster houses around 100,000, and it's estimated that there are
                100 billion observable galaxies in the universe. The distinction between galaxies and other interstellar
                formations like nebulae was elucidated in the 1920s. Initial systematic efforts to catalog galaxies
                began in the 1960s, yielding listings such as the Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies,
                documenting 29,418 entries, and the Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies, which purportedly encompassed
                all galaxies with photographic magnitude surpassing 15, totaling 30,642. The Lyons Groups of Galaxies in
                the 1980s identified 485 galaxy groups containing 3,933 member galaxies. Galaxy Zoo, initiated in July
                2007, endeavors for a more exhaustive compilation, having classified over a million galaxy images
                sourced from The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, The Hubble Space Telescope, and the Cosmic Assembly
                Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. Galaxies lack a universal nomenclature convention, often
                being labeled based on celestial coordinates in conjunction with the observing project's name (e.g.,
                HUDF, SDSS, 3C, CFHQS, NGC/IC, etc.), prior to definitive confirmation of their galactic status.
